I am a PhD student at the [Toyota Technolgical Institute at Chicago](https:https://www.ttic.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Matthew Turk](https://www.ttic.edu/faculty/turk/). My research interest lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My current research focuses on building fairer decsion making systems with humans in the loop. I also enjoy building robots but more like a hobby. 
    
Previously, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) where I closely worked with [Dr. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) on Goal-Oriented Visual Dialogue.
