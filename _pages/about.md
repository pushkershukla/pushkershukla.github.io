I am a PhD student at the [Toyota Technolgical Institute at Chicago](https:https://www.ttic.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Matthew Turk](https://www.ttic.edu/faculty/turk/). working at the intersection of fairness, computer vision, and interpretability. My research addresses critical issues in  AI models , including bias detection, counterfactual causal analysis, and safety evaluations. I am passionate about building solutions that bridge the gap between ethical AI development and practical applications. 
    
Previously, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) where I closely worked with [Dr. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) on Goal-Oriented Visual Dialogue. As an early reseacher I spent seven transformative years in the charming town of Roorkee, in Northern India. Those years were incredibly formative, leaving a lasting impact on my personal growth and shaping the person I am today. 

When I’m not diving into research, you’ll probably find me trying out new recipes in the kitchen— trying experimenting with different flavours or enjoying a run/walk/hike outdoors.
